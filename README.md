Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js v14+

npm

Installation
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/v2v-communication-system.git
cd v2v-communication-system
npm install
Running the App
You need a simple Express (or similar) backend to serve static files and process users.

bash
npm start
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Sign Up: Register as a new user via /signup.html

Login: Authenticate via /login.html

Profile: Update/view your profile at /profile.html

Notifications: Allow notifications to receive push messages

Offline Support: Install the PWA from your browser for offline usage

Configuration
Service Worker: service-worker.js provides offline caching and handles push notifications.

User Data: User accounts are managed in users.json (as a demo; production should use a real database).

Manifest: PWA settings are defined in manifest.json.

Dependencies
express - Node.js web server

leaflet - Interactive maps

font-awesome - Icons

Roboto - Fonts

Additional dependencies may be listed in package.json.

Security Notes
Demo Only:
This project uses plain JSON files for user data and stores passwords in plaintext for demonstration purposes only. Do not use this code in production. For a real application, always use secure password hashing, HTTPS, and a DBMS.
